Udacity Full Stack Web Development - Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
## Synopsis

This is my first of a series of projects through Udacity's **Full Stack Web Development** course, through which I have been learning Python.  The project utilizes what I've learned about classes to create a simple movie database that is then rendered in a webpage.

## Installation

To render the website, you'll need to use Python to run **entertainment_center.py**.
